## MORSE CODE CONVERTER
Little simple project coded in Python, intended to be a lighthearted restart my GitHub account.

At first I thought of only converting alphanumerical text to Morse code but, as I started coding, I thought it would be more fun if it was possible to do the reverse operation as well! Took only numbers and letters into consideration - other characters aren't converted.
